            Get ready for a delicious surprise! Join the Sweet Bunny on a hunt
            for yummy treats in the magical chocolate forest. Sweet Miner is a
            Mine Game inspired by classic Minesweeper video games and modern
            crypto currency games.

            The game consists of a 5x5 grid of colourful easter egg tiles, click
            on any tile to reveal a golden chocolate bunny. With every golden
            bunny you discover your total winnings increase. But look out for
            rotten eggs! If you happen upon a rotten egg, it will crack open and
            all fortune is lost.

          <div className="sc-gGLxEB dGJRan">
            You can set the number of rotten eggs on the grid between 1 and 24.
            The more rotten eggs, the riskier the hunt for yummy treats becomes.
            How long you stay in the game is up to you - cash out after one safe
            reveal, or risk it all for a chance at more chocolate than you can
            eat! Good luck!

            The following sections explain the underlying mechanics of the game.
            At the base of all Mine Games are the two fundamental game
            components TREASURE and MINE. Treasures award a multiplier to the
            players bet, while mines result in the players loss of the bet. In
            Sweet Miner the treasures are represented by golden chocolate
            bunnies and the mines are represented by rotten eggs. However, in
            these following sections we retain the terminology TREASURE and MINE
            to explain the underlying mechanics.

            TreasureBoost is an automatic, random feature that increases the
            players’ chance of revealing a treasure as opposed to a Rotten Egg.
            This increased chance of revealing a treasure is not a fixed amount
            that is simply applied whenever the feature is active. The level of
            increased chance will vary, based on the current status of the
            ongoing game round.
